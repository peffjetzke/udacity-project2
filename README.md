# Udacity - Project 2: Landing Page
This project is about javascript and DOM manipulation, as well as testing skills learned in the previous project.

## What was learned?
The skills needed to create, edit, or remove page (document) objects such as HTML elements in order to create a more dynamic experience.

To quote myself on this:
> It felt like mostly a lesson in loops and when to call events
